# Site Analyzer Platform

[![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/landyking/site-analyzer/actions/workflows/site-analyzer-pipeline.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/landyking/site-analyzer/actions/workflows/site-analyzer-pipeline.yml)

A comprehensive platform for Solar Power Site Suitability Analysis, featuring a backend API service, a web-based frontend, and a raster tile service (TiTiler). The system enables users to analyze geographical areas for solar power installation suitability, manage analysis tasks, and visualize results.

## üìã Overview

Site Analyzer empowers users to assess map regions for solar power site suitability by considering various constraint and suitability factors. Users can create analysis tasks for specific districts, review detailed suitability assessments, and interact with results through an intuitive web interface.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The platform consists of three main components:

- **Backend API Service**:

  - RESTful API design
  - User Management: Authentication and authorization with OIDC support
  - Map Task Management: Analysis task creation, processing, and result management
  - File Management: Handling of analysis result files and reports

- **Web Frontend**:
  - Interactive map visualization
  - Task creation and management UI
  - Display of suitability analysis results
  - User authentication

- **TiTiler Tile Service**:

  - Dynamic raster tiling for Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs)
  - On-the-fly rendering and XYZ/WMTS tile endpoints
  - Serves analysis outputs and base layers to the web frontend

## üöÄ Getting Started

Set up the full stack locally for development.

Prerequisites:
- Docker Desktop (with Compose v2)
- Git, and the usual runtime tooling that each subproject requires (see each component's README)

1) Clone the repository

  ```bash
  git clone <repo-url>
  ```

2) Prepare middleware/services via Docker Compose
  - From the repository root:

    ```bash
    # Start databases, caches, and other dependencies defined in docker-compose.yml
    docker compose up -d

    # (Optional) Inspect logs if something doesn't start as expected
    docker compose logs -f
    ```

  - To stop services later:

    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

3) Prepare input data
  - Collect the geospatial layers listed in the `Default Datasets` section below (or your own equivalents) and place the source files under the `test-data/` directory.

4) Start TiTiler (raster tile service)
  - In a new terminal:
    - `cd titiler`
    - Follow the steps in [`titiler/README.md`](./titiler/README.md) to run the service.

5) Start the Backend API
  - In another terminal:
    - `cd backend`
    - Follow [`backend/README.md`](./backend/README.md) for local configuration and how to run the API server.

6) Start the Web Frontend
  - In another terminal:
    - `cd webfront`
    - Follow [`webfront/README.md`](./webfront/README.md) to install dependencies and start the dev server.

7) Access the app
  - Open the web frontend in your browser (port and URL as documented in `webfront/README.md`).
  - Ensure the backend API and TiTiler endpoints configured in the frontend match your local ports.

Notes:
- If ports conflict on your machine, adjust them in the respective component configs or `docker-compose.yml` and keep them consistent across services.
- For environment variables (database URLs, service endpoints, OIDC settings), use the examples and guidance in each component's README.

 

## üåê Live Demo

Try the hosted demo at https://solar.y2ki.com/

- Access: Use the Demo account shown on the sign-in page to log in.
- Limitations: The demo environment runs under a read-only mode due to resource constraints and security considerations.
- Explore: Browse the built-in example map data to see typical analysis outputs and interactions.
- Full experience: For all features and best performance, run the platform locally following the Backend, Webfront, and TiTiler setup guides above.

## üîÑ Continuous Integration & Deployment

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD. For detailed information about the pipeline configuration, deployment process, and local testing, see [**CI/CD Documentation**](docs/CICD.md).

## üó∫Ô∏è Default Datasets

These default geospatial layers are provided as baseline inputs for constraint and suitability scoring; they can be customized or extended per analysis.

The platform ships with a curated set of publicly available New Zealand geospatial datasets used as defaults for constraint and suitability scoring. These layers are sourced from LRIS, LINZ, and Stats NZ.

| **Dataset Name**                           | **Purpose**                                                             | **Source**                                                                                    |

These defaults are intended to provide a robust baseline for analysis across New Zealand. Depending on your study area and objectives, you may incorporate additional layers (e.g., protected areas, flood zones) or update the sources to more recent releases.

## üß∞ Data Preparation

When working with geospatial data, it is often necessary to ensure that the coordinate reference systems (CRS) of different datasets are consistent. This is particularly important when performing operations like rasterization or distance calculations.

If the raster data's coordinate reference system (CRS) is not consistent with the shapefile, we can reproject the raster data using GDAL's `gdalwarp` command. This command allows us to specify the target CRS and apply compression options to optimize the output file size.

```bash
# rio info xxx.tif
gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:2193 -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -co PREDICTOR=2 -co ZLEVEL=9 -tr 25 25 input.tif output_compressed.tif
# gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:2193 -co COMPRESS=LZW input.tif output_compressed.tif
```
