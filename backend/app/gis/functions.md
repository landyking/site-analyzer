# Functions

We need to implement several functions using open-source libraries or tools. Below is a list of required functions, each with a description and a reference to the equivalent functionality in `arcpy` (a commercial GIS library).

### Select and extract features from a shapefile

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.Select_analysis(large_shapefile, small_shapefile, conditions_expression)`

**Requirement:** 
Extract a subset of features from a large shapefile based on attribute or spatial conditions, creating a smaller shapefile containing only the selected features.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use open-source tools such as `ogr2ogr` or Python libraries like `geopandas` to perform the selection and extraction. For example, with `geopandas`, filter the input shapefile using attribute queries (e.g., selecting features from a specific district) and save the filtered data to a new shapefile.

### Create buffer zones from a shapefile

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.Buffer_analysis(input, output, buffer_distances, "", "", "ALL")`

**Requirement:**  
Generate buffer zones around features in a shapefile, allowing for spatial analysis of proximity.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Utilize `geopandas` to create buffer zones. Load the shapefile into a GeoDataFrame, then use the `buffer` method to create the buffer zones. Finally, save the resulting GeoDataFrame to a new shapefile.

### Clip a shapefile to a specific area

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.Clip_analysis(output, whole_area, boundary)`

**Requirement:**  
Clip a shapefile to a specific area defined by another shapefile, retaining only the features that fall within the clipping boundary.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `geopandas` to perform the clipping operation. Load both the input shapefile and the clipping boundary shapefile into separate GeoDataFrames. Use the `clip` method to retain only the features from the input GeoDataFrame that fall within the clipping boundary. Finally, save the clipped GeoDataFrame to a new shapefile.

### Union multiple shapefiles

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.Union_analysis([input1, input2, ...], output)`

**Requirement:**  
Combine multiple shapefiles into a single shapefile, merging their geometries and attributes.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `geopandas` to read all input shapefiles into GeoDataFrames, then use `geopandas.overlay` with `how='union'` or `geopandas.GeoDataFrame.append`/`pd.concat` for simple concatenation. Save the result to a new shapefile.

### Convert polygons to raster

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.PolygonToRaster_conversion(input, value_field, output, cell_assignment)`

**Requirement:**  
Convert a polygon shapefile to a raster format, assigning raster cell values based on a field in the input polygons.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `rasterio` and `rasterio.features.rasterize` to burn polygons from a GeoDataFrame into a raster. Set the transform, shape, and value field as needed. Save the raster using `rasterio`.

### Extract raster by mask

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.sa.ExtractByMask(input_raster, mask_shapefile)`

**Requirement:**  
Extract the cells of a raster that fall within the area defined by a shapefile mask, setting other cells to nodata.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `rasterio.mask.mask` to mask a raster with a vector geometry (from a shapefile loaded with `geopandas`). Save the masked raster with `rasterio`.

### Calculate distance raster from features

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.sa.DistanceAccumulation(in_source_data)`

**Requirement:**  
Generate a raster where each cell value represents the distance to the nearest feature in the input vector data.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt` for rasterized features, or `rasterio` + `shapely` to rasterize features and compute distances. Libraries like `whitebox` or `gdal_proximity.py` can also be used for distance rasters.

### Conditional raster calculation

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.sa.Con(condition, true_value, false_value)`

**Requirement:**  
Create a raster where cell values are set based on a condition (e.g., if a cell meets a criterion, assign one value; otherwise, another).

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `numpy.where` on raster arrays loaded with `rasterio` to perform conditional assignments. Save the result as a raster with `rasterio`.

### Check for null raster values

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.sa.IsNull(raster)`

**Requirement:**  
Identify cells in a raster that have nodata/null values.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `numpy.isnan` or compare to the raster's nodata value in arrays loaded with `rasterio`.

### Reclassify raster values (remap by range)

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.sa.Reclassify(raster, "Value", RemapRange([...]))`

**Requirement:**  
Reclassify raster cell values into new categories or ranges, as defined by a mapping table.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `numpy.digitize` or custom `numpy` logic to map input raster values to new classes. Save the reclassified raster with `rasterio`.
