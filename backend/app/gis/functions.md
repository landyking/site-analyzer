# Functions

We need to implement several functions using open-source libraries or tools. Below is a list of required functions, each with a description and a reference to the equivalent functionality in `arcpy` (a commercial GIS library).

### Select and extract features from a shapefile

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.Select_analysis(large_shapefile, small_shapefile, conditions_expression)`

**Requirement:** 
Extract a subset of features from a large shapefile based on attribute or spatial conditions, creating a smaller shapefile containing only the selected features.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use open-source tools such as `ogr2ogr` or Python libraries like `geopandas` to perform the selection and extraction. For example, with `geopandas`, filter the input shapefile using attribute queries (e.g., selecting features from a specific district) and save the filtered data to a new shapefile.

```python
import geopandas as gpd
gdf = gpd.read_file('large_shapefile.shp')
# Example: select features where 'district' == 'A'
selected = gdf[gdf['district'] == 'A']
selected.to_file('small_shapefile.shp')
```

### Create buffer zones from a shapefile

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.Buffer_analysis(input, output, buffer_distances, "", "", "ALL")`

**Requirement:**  
Generate buffer zones around features in a shapefile, allowing for spatial analysis of proximity.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Utilize `geopandas` to create buffer zones. Load the shapefile into a GeoDataFrame, then use the `buffer` method to create the buffer zones. Finally, save the resulting GeoDataFrame to a new shapefile.

```python
import geopandas as gpd
gdf = gpd.read_file('input.shp')
# Buffer distance in meters (adjust CRS as needed)
gdf['geometry'] = gdf.buffer(100)
gdf.to_file('buffered_output.shp')
```

### Clip a shapefile to a specific area

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.Clip_analysis(output, whole_area, boundary)`

**Requirement:**  
Clip a shapefile to a specific area defined by another shapefile, retaining only the features that fall within the clipping boundary.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `geopandas` to perform the clipping operation. Load both the input shapefile and the clipping boundary shapefile into separate GeoDataFrames. Use the `clip` method to retain only the features from the input GeoDataFrame that fall within the clipping boundary. Finally, save the clipped GeoDataFrame to a new shapefile.

```python
import geopandas as gpd
gdf = gpd.read_file('input.shp')
boundary = gpd.read_file('boundary.shp')
clipped = gpd.clip(gdf, boundary)
clipped.to_file('clipped_output.shp')
```

### Union multiple shapefiles

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.Union_analysis([input1, input2, ...], output)`

**Requirement:**  
Combine multiple shapefiles into a single shapefile, merging their geometries and attributes.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `geopandas` to read all input shapefiles into GeoDataFrames, then use `geopandas.overlay` with `how='union'` or `geopandas.GeoDataFrame.append`/`pd.concat` for simple concatenation. Save the result to a new shapefile.

```python
import geopandas as gpd
gdf1 = gpd.read_file('input1.shp')
gdf2 = gpd.read_file('input2.shp')
union = gpd.overlay(gdf1, gdf2, how='union')
union.to_file('union_output.shp')
```

### Convert polygons to raster

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.PolygonToRaster_conversion(input, value_field, output, cell_assignment)`

**Requirement:**  
Convert a polygon shapefile to a raster format, assigning raster cell values based on a field in the input polygons.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `rasterio` and `rasterio.features.rasterize` to burn polygons from a GeoDataFrame into a raster. Set the transform, shape, and value field as needed. Save the raster using `rasterio`.

```python
import geopandas as gpd
import rasterio
from rasterio.features import rasterize
from rasterio.transform import from_origin
gdf = gpd.read_file('polygons.shp')
transform = from_origin(0, 1000, 10, 10)  # left, top, xres, yres
out_shape = (100, 100)
shapes = ((geom, value) for geom, value in zip(gdf.geometry, gdf['value_field']))
raster = rasterize(shapes, out_shape=out_shape, transform=transform)
with rasterio.open('output.tif', 'w', driver='GTiff',
                   height=out_shape[0], width=out_shape[1], count=1,
                   dtype=raster.dtype, transform=transform) as dst:
    dst.write(raster, 1)
```

### Extract raster by mask

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.sa.ExtractByMask(input_raster, mask_shapefile)`

**Requirement:**  
Extract the cells of a raster that fall within the area defined by a shapefile mask, setting other cells to nodata.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `rasterio.mask.mask` to mask a raster with a vector geometry (from a shapefile loaded with `geopandas`). Save the masked raster with `rasterio`.

```python
import rasterio
import geopandas as gpd
from rasterio.mask import mask
gdf = gpd.read_file('mask.shp')
with rasterio.open('input.tif') as src:
    out_image, out_transform = mask(src, gdf.geometry, crop=True)
    out_meta = src.meta.copy()
out_meta.update({"height": out_image.shape[1], "width": out_image.shape[2], "transform": out_transform})
with rasterio.open('masked_output.tif', 'w', **out_meta) as dest:
    dest.write(out_image)
```

### Calculate distance raster from features

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.sa.DistanceAccumulation(in_source_data)`

**Requirement:**  
Generate a raster where each cell value represents the distance to the nearest feature in the input vector data.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt` for rasterized features, or `rasterio` + `shapely` to rasterize features and compute distances. Libraries like `whitebox` or `gdal_proximity.py` can also be used for distance rasters.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.ndimage import distance_transform_edt
# binary_mask: 1 where feature exists, 0 elsewhere
distance = distance_transform_edt(1 - binary_mask)
```

### Conditional raster calculation

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.sa.Con(condition, true_value, false_value)`

**Requirement:**  
Create a raster where cell values are set based on a condition (e.g., if a cell meets a criterion, assign one value; otherwise, another).

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `numpy.where` on raster arrays loaded with `rasterio` to perform conditional assignments. Save the result as a raster with `rasterio`.

```python
import rasterio
import numpy as np
with rasterio.open('input.tif') as src:
    arr = src.read(1)
    result = np.where(arr > 10, 1, 0)
    meta = src.meta
with rasterio.open('output.tif', 'w', **meta) as dst:
    dst.write(result, 1)
```

### Check for null raster values

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.sa.IsNull(raster)`

**Requirement:**  
Identify cells in a raster that have nodata/null values.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `numpy.isnan` or compare to the raster's nodata value in arrays loaded with `rasterio`.

```python
import rasterio
import numpy as np
with rasterio.open('input.tif') as src:
    arr = src.read(1)
    nodata = src.nodata
    is_null = np.isnan(arr) if nodata is None else (arr == nodata)
```

### Reclassify raster values (remap by range)

**arcpy Reference:**  
`arcpy.sa.Reclassify(raster, "Value", RemapRange([...]))`

**Requirement:**  
Reclassify raster cell values into new categories or ranges, as defined by a mapping table.

**Implementation Suggestion:**  
Use `numpy.digitize` or custom `numpy` logic to map input raster values to new classes. Save the reclassified raster with `rasterio`.

```python
import rasterio
import numpy as np
with rasterio.open('input.tif') as src:
    arr = src.read(1)
    # Example: bins = [0, 10, 20, 30], classes = [1, 2, 3]
    bins = [0, 10, 20, 30]
    classes = [1, 2, 3]
    reclass = np.digitize(arr, bins, right=True)
    meta = src.meta
with rasterio.open('reclass_output.tif', 'w', **meta) as dst:
    dst.write(reclass, 1)
```
